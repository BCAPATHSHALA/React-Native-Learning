# PRACTICEDAY01

This is my first react native project in the PRACTICEDAY01. I am learning React Native with the help of the [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs) and [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/).

## Step 1: Install the CLI and create a new app

[Install the CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started-without-a-framework)

```sh
pnpm i @react-native-community/cli
pnpx @react-native-community/cli@latest init project01
```

## Step 2: Connect to the Real Android Device

[Connect to the Real Android Device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)

1. Enable Debugging over USB
2. Plug in your device via USB
3. Run `adb devices` in a terminal to see a list of connected devices

## Step 3: Build and run your app

```sh
pnpm run android
```
